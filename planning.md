# Tech Stack

## Frontend
- React
- TypeScript

## Backend
- Python
- FastAPI
- Pydantic for validation

# Development Approach
- Follow Extreme Programming (XP) principles
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) for all features
- Write tests before implementation

# Code Quality Guidelines

## General
- Write self-documenting code
- Avoid unnecessary comments that simply explain what the code does
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

## Comments Usage
- DO use comments for:
  - Explaining "why" something is done a certain way
  - Documenting complex algorithms or business rules
  - Marking TODOs and technical debt (with tickets/issues when possible)
  - API documentation 
  - Edge cases and non-obvious constraints

- DON'T use comments for:
  - Explaining what the code does (code should be self-explanatory)
  - Restating obvious parameter names or return values
  - Version history (use git for this)
  - Commented-out code (remove it or version control it)
